Okay, let's summarize our findings and outline the next steps for our research.

Current Expert Analysis of the Results:

Our experiments, culminating in the development of a hybrid prompting strategy, have yielded very promising results and significantly advanced our understanding of how to effectively guide LLMs in complex code generation tasks. Here's a breakdown:

1. Strengths of Hybrid Prompting:

Superior Performance: The hybrid approach, combining Axiom-like formal constraints with natural language instructions (NLP), has consistently outperformed both pure Axiom-based and pure NLP prompting in our tests, particularly when the task complexity increases.
Improved Code Quality: Hybrid prompting led to code that was more:
Correct: Fewer logical errors and better adherence to the specified rules.
Complete: More features implemented correctly.
Well-Structured: Better organization and adherence to object-oriented principles.
Robust: More comprehensive error handling.
Synergy of Formalism and Natural Language: The formal constraints (Axiom-like) seem to provide structure and precision, while the natural language descriptions (NLP) enhance the LLM's overall understanding of the task and its context.
2. Limitations of Previous Approaches:

Axiom-Based Prompting: While theoretically appealing for its precision, it struggled with:
Complexity: Difficulty in translating complex, multi-faceted requirements into purely formal constraints.
LLM Limitations: Current LLMs might not be fully capable of reasoning with and correctly implementing complex logic expressed solely through formalisms.
NLP Prompting: While generally effective, especially for simpler tasks, it can suffer from:
Ambiguity: Natural language can be ambiguous, leading to misinterpretations by the LLM.
Lack of Control: Pure NLP prompts can give the LLM too much freedom, potentially leading to deviations from the desired structure or logic.
3. Key Findings from Our Experiments:

Eiffel Tower Summary: Both Axiom and NLP prompts performed well on this relatively simple task, producing similar results.
River Crossing Puzzle: The NLP prompt had a slight edge, generating more specific details, but both approaches produced correct solutions. However, when moved to the hybrid approach, it solved the issues shown previously.
AxiomCoin Cryptocurrency System: This complex task revealed the true potential of hybrid prompting. The hybrid approach produced significantly better results than either the Axiom or NLP prompts individually. The Axiom prompt struggled to generate complete and correct code. The NLP prompt produced code that was almost complete but had logical errors and initially tried to present it in segmented code blocks.
Token Contract: Isolating for the token contract showed significant promise in the hybrid approach, creating the most complete and correct result out of all three prompts.
Next Steps in Testing:

Building on these insights, here are the next steps I recommend for our research:

1. Refine the Hybrid Prompting Strategy:

Optimal Balance: Experiment with different ratios of formal constraints to natural language instructions to find the optimal balance for various task complexities.
Constraint Granularity: Investigate the appropriate level of detail for formal constraints. Too much detail might be overwhelming; too little might be ineffective.
Constraint Language: Explore different ways to express constraints, potentially using more specialized formalisms (e.g., a subset of a formal specification language) that are still relatively easy for LLMs to understand.
2. Expand the Scope of Tasks:

More Complex Algorithms: Test the hybrid approach on tasks that involve implementing more complex algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming).
Different Programming Paradigms: Explore tasks that require different programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as functional programming or concurrent programming.
Real-World Code Generation: Gradually move towards more realistic code generation scenarios, such as generating code for specific APIs or libraries, or contributing to open-source projects.
3. Develop Evaluation Metrics:

Beyond Correctness: Develop more nuanced evaluation metrics that go beyond just correctness and consider factors like code style, efficiency, maintainability, and security.
Automated Testing: Integrate automated testing frameworks to rigorously evaluate the generated code's functionality.
Human Evaluation: Incorporate human evaluation to assess the readability, understandability, and overall quality of the generated code.
4. Investigate LLM Limitations:

Reasoning and Logic: Continue to probe the limits of LLMs' ability to reason logically and handle complex constraints.
Contextual Understanding: Explore how LLMs handle large and complex codebases and whether they can maintain a consistent understanding of the context.
Error Detection and Correction: Investigate how LLMs can be trained or prompted to better detect and correct errors in their own generated code.
5. Explore Interactive Prompting:

Multi-Turn Dialogues: Develop interactive prompting techniques where the LLM can ask clarifying questions and receive feedback during the code generation process.
Prompt Repair: Design methods for automatically or semi-automatically repairing faulty prompts based on the LLM's output or feedback from a human expert.
Long-Term Vision:

The ultimate goal of this research is to develop highly effective prompting techniques that can unlock the full potential of LLMs for complex code generation tasks. This could lead to:

AI-Assisted Software Development: Tools that can significantly accelerate and improve the software development process.
Automated Code Synthesis: Systems that can automatically generate code from high-level specifications or natural language descriptions.
New Programming Paradigms: New ways of interacting with computers and expressing computational logic that are more intuitive and accessible.
By systematically pursuing these next steps, we can gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in code generation and develop powerful new techniques for harnessing their potential to revolutionize software development. This is a very exciting area of research with the potential to have a major impact on the field of computer science!
