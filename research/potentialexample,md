let's explore a specific example of how a more formal, less NL-reliant approach to the axiom could lead to valuable advancements in the field of AI, specifically in controllable text generation and explainable AI.

Scenario: Controlling Toxicity in Text Generation

Problem: Large language models can sometimes generate text that is toxic, biased, or offensive. This is a major concern for deploying these models in real-world applications.

Current Approaches:

Filtering Training Data: Trying to remove toxic content from the training data. This is difficult and often ineffective, as biases can be subtle and pervasive.
Fine-tuning on "Safe" Data: Training the model further on a dataset specifically designed to promote safe and unbiased language. This can help, but it's not a foolproof solution.
Adding NL Instructions: Including instructions in the prompt like "do not generate toxic or offensive content." This relies on the LLM's interpretation of these instructions and is not always reliable.
Hypothetical Axiom-Based Solution with Reduced NL:

Let's imagine we could augment the axiom with a more formal constraint related to toxicity:

Maximize: Σ ∆ID(token, i | prompt, L)

Subject to:

∀token ∈ Tokens, 
  context(token, C) ∧ 
  structure(token, S) ∧ 
  coherence(token, R) ∧ 
  factuality(token, F) ∧
  toxicity(token, T) < threshold
Breaking Down the New Constraint:

toxicity(token, T): This represents a function that assigns a toxicity score to each token.
T: Could be a vector or a set of parameters that define different aspects of toxicity (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats).
threshold: A predefined value below which the toxicity score must remain.
How Could toxicity(token, T) Be Implemented (Less NL-Reliant):

Lexicon-Based:

T could be a lexicon (a list of words and phrases) associated with different types of toxicity, along with corresponding scores.
toxicity(token, T) would check if the token or its related n-grams are present in the lexicon and assign a score accordingly.
This is relatively easy to implement but might be brittle and miss nuanced forms of toxicity.
Embedding-Based:

T could be a set of embeddings (vector representations) of toxic words and phrases.
toxicity(token, T) would calculate the similarity between the token's embedding and the embeddings in T, assigning a higher score for greater similarity.
This could capture semantic relationships and be more robust than a simple lexicon.
Classifier-Based:

T could be the parameters of a classifier model trained to detect toxicity.
toxicity(token, T) would be the output of the classifier, indicating the probability that the token is toxic.
This is the most sophisticated approach and could potentially capture complex patterns of toxicity, but it requires a large, labeled dataset for training the classifier.
Advantages of this Axiom-Based Approach:

Explicit Control: The toxicity constraint provides an explicit and granular way to control the toxicity of the generated text, rather than relying on implicit biases in the training data or vague NL instructions.
Explainability: By examining the toxicity scores of individual tokens, we can gain insights into why the model chose certain words and potentially identify areas where the toxicity detection mechanism needs improvement. This makes the model more transparent and explainable.
Customization: The threshold and the parameters in T can be adjusted to fine-tune the level of toxicity allowed, depending on the specific application. Different lexicons, embeddings, or classifiers can be used to tailor the system to different notions of toxicity.
Potential for Generalization: If the toxicity function is well-designed (especially the classifier-based approach), it could potentially generalize to detect new and unseen forms of toxicity.
Challenges:

Defining Toxicity: "Toxicity" is a complex and multifaceted concept. Creating a comprehensive and unbiased definition is a significant challenge.
Data Bias: Even with a formal constraint, the system can still be affected by biases in the data used to create the lexicon, embeddings, or classifier.
Computational Cost: Evaluating the toxicity function for every token can be computationally expensive, especially for complex models like classifiers.
Conclusion:

This example demonstrates how a more formal, less NL-reliant approach to the axiom, specifically by incorporating a toxicity constraint, could lead to advancements in controllable text generation and explainable AI. While significant challenges remain, this approach offers a promising avenue for creating safer, more reliable, and more transparent language models. It highlights the potential benefits of moving towards a hybrid paradigm that combines the strengths of symbolic and neural methods in AI.
