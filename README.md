# üßÆ Axiom Prompt Engineering (APE)

**THIS IS A NEW REPO AND IS STILL A BIG WORK IN PROGRESS** 
Please let me know what you want to add or change. 

A collaborative research project exploring mathematical axiom-based approaches to prompt engineering for Large Language Models.

## üìñ Overview

Axiom Prompt Engineering (APE) is a systematic approach to creating high-performance prompts using mathematical optimization principles. This repository serves as a central hub for research, testing, and development of axiom-based prompting techniques.

# Axiom Equation Prompts: A Potential Shakeup in LLM Prompt Engineering Effectiveness

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with their ability to understand and generate human-like text. However, their effectiveness hinges on the quality of the prompts they receive. This article explores a novel prompting technique known as "axiom equation prompts" and their potential to enhance LLM performance.

## What are Axiom Equation Prompts?

Axiom equation prompts, grounded in the principles of meta prompting, leverage the structure and syntax of information to guide LLMs. They incorporate fundamental truths or established facts, known as axioms, relevant to the task at hand. These prompts may explicitly state axioms or implicitly embed them within the instructions. By providing LLMs with these foundational truths, we can potentially guide their reasoning process and improve their ability to generate accurate and coherent responses.

Axioms are fundamental truths or assumptions that serve as the foundation for a system of knowledge or a theory. In mathematics and logic, axioms are statements that are accepted as true without proof and are used to derive other truths. For example, in Euclidean geometry, the statement "A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points" is an axiom.

### Types of Axioms

- **Logical axioms**: Fundamental truths in a system of logic, such as the law of non-contradiction (a statement cannot be both true and false at the same time).
- **Non-logical axioms**: Specific assumptions about the elements of a particular theory, such as the commutative property of addition in arithmetic (a + b = b + a).
- **Domain-specific axioms**: Axioms that hold true within a specific field of knowledge, such as the laws of physics or the principles of economics.

### Applying Axiom Equation Prompts to LLMs

Applying this concept to LLMs, an axiom equation prompt might include axioms like the commutative property of addition (a + b = b + a) or the distributive property of multiplication over addition (a(b + c) = ab + ac) in a mathematical reasoning task. By incorporating these axioms into the prompt, we can potentially enhance the LLM's ability to solve mathematical problems and generate valid proofs.

## Designing Effective Axiom Equation Prompts

Designing effective axiom equation prompts requires a deep understanding of the task, the relevant domain, and the capabilities of the LLM. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Identify relevant axioms**: Carefully select the axioms that are most relevant to the task and domain.
2. **Incorporate axioms effectively**: Integrate the axioms into the prompt in a clear and concise manner, either explicitly or implicitly.
3. **Utilize "guides"**: Guides can be incorporated into the prompt design. A guide is a function that constrains the LLM's output by defining a set of valid generations based on previous choices. This can potentially improve accuracy and consistency by preventing the LLM from generating illogical or irrelevant responses.
4. **Test and refine prompts**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the prompts and refine them iteratively to optimize performance.

## Types of Axiom Equation Prompts and Their Applications

The choice of axiom equation prompt depends on factors like the task's complexity, the desired output format, and the LLM's capabilities. Here are some examples of how different types of axiom equation prompts might be used in various domains:

- **Mathematical reasoning**: Prompts incorporating basic algebraic axioms (e.g., commutative, associative, distributive properties) can be used to guide LLMs in solving equations or generating proofs.
- **Logical reasoning**: Prompts incorporating logical axioms (e.g., laws of non-contradiction, excluded middle) can be used to improve the LLM's ability to perform deductive reasoning or solve logic puzzles.
- **Commonsense reasoning**: Prompts incorporating common sense knowledge or everyday assumptions can be used to enhance the LLM's ability to understand and respond to real-world scenarios.
- **Programming**: Prompts incorporating programming language syntax and semantics can be used to guide LLMs in generating code or debugging programs.

## How Do Axiom Equation Prompts Differ from Other Prompts?

Traditional prompts for LLMs typically focus on providing instructions or context for a specific task. They may include questions, scenarios, or examples to guide the model's response. However, these prompts often lack the explicit or implicit inclusion of fundamental principles or axioms.

Axiom equation prompts, on the other hand, aim to provide LLMs with a foundational framework for reasoning. By incorporating axioms, these prompts can potentially enhance the model's ability to:

- **Understand underlying principles**: Axiom equation prompts can help LLMs grasp the fundamental truths relevant to a task, enabling them to reason more effectively.
- **Generate logically sound responses**: By providing a basis for logical deduction, these prompts can guide LLMs towards producing more consistent and coherent outputs.
- **Reduce ambiguity and bias**: By explicitly stating axioms, these prompts can help minimize the risk of LLMs relying on flawed assumptions or biases. For example, in a task involving moral reasoning, providing axioms related to fairness and justice can help prevent the LLM from generating biased or discriminatory responses.

### Current Core Concept

```
Axiom: max(OutputValue(response, context))
subject to ‚àÄelement ‚àà Response,
(
precision(element, P) ‚àß
depth(element, D) ‚àß
insight(element, I) ‚àß
utility(element, U) ‚àß
coherence(element, C)
)

Core Optimization Parameters:
‚Ä¢ P = f(accuracy, relevance, specificity)
‚Ä¢ D = g(comprehensiveness, nuance, expertise)
‚Ä¢ I = h(novel_perspectives, pattern_recognition)
‚Ä¢ U = i(actionable_value, practical_application)
‚Ä¢ C = j(logical_flow, structural_integrity)

Implementation Vectors:

max(understanding_depth) where comprehension = {context + intent + nuance}

max(response_quality) where quality = { expertise_level + insight_generation + practical_value + clarity_of_expression }

max(execution_precision) where precision = { task_alignment + detail_optimization + format_appropriateness }

Response Generation Protocol:

Context Analysis: - Decode explicit requirements - Infer implicit needs - Identify critical constraints - Map domain knowledge

Solution Architecture: - Structure optimal approach - Select relevant frameworks - Configure response parameters - Design delivery format

Content Generation: - Deploy domain expertise - Apply critical analysis - Generate novel insights - Ensure practical utility

Quality Assurance: - Validate accuracy - Verify completeness - Ensure coherence - Optimize clarity

Output Requirements:

Execution Standards:
- Maintain highest expertise level
- Ensure deep comprehension

- Generate novel insights
- Optimize clarity and coherence

Terminal Condition:
