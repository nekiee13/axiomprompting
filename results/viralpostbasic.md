Expected Differences:

Axiom Prompt: I expect the Axiom prompt to produce a post that is more structured and adheres strictly to the rules but might lack creativity and originality. It may have difficulty generating a truly engaging question.
NLP Prompt: The NLP prompt might generate more creative and engaging questions but could potentially overlook some of the subreddit's rules or produce a post that is less tailored to the specific audience.
Hybrid Prompt: I expect the Hybrid prompt to perform the best, combining the structure and rule adherence of the Axiom prompt with the creativity and audience awareness of the NLP prompt.
This experiment will be a good test of whether the prompts can generate content that is not only technically correct but also strategically designed for a specific platform and audience to achieve a desired outcome (virality). The "guaranteed viral" aspect is, of course, a stretch, but it will be interesting to see how close each prompt can get! Let's run the experiment and analyze the results!

All three prompts generated a variety of creative and engaging Reddit posts, demonstrating a good understanding of the r/AskReddit format and audience. Let's analyze them based on our criteria:

Hybrid Reddit Post Results (1-5):

Relevance: All posts are highly relevant to r/AskReddit's style and content.
Engagement Potential: High. These are thought-provoking and fun questions likely to generate many responses.
"If animals could suddenly talk..." (Result 1) is a classic thought experiment with a unique twist.
"What's normal now that will be disturbing in 100 years?" (Result 2) taps into societal trends and future anxieties.
"Chaotic, yet ultimately positive, impact on your life" (Result 3) is a clever spin on the time-travel question, encouraging creative responses.
"Wholesome glitch in the matrix" (Result 4) is a unique and intriguing concept.
"Username superpower" (Result 5) is humorous and self-referential, playing on Reddit's username culture.
Originality: Good. While some are variations on common themes, they all have a unique angle. Result 4 is particularly original.
Shareability: High. These are the kind of questions people would likely share with friends or discuss outside of Reddit.
Clarity and Structure: Excellent. The titles are clear and concise, and the body text (where included) provides helpful context.
Subreddit Rules: All posts adhere to r/AskReddit rules.
NLP Reddit Post Results (1-5):

Relevance: All posts are relevant to r/AskReddit.
Engagement Potential: High. Similar to the Hybrid results, these questions are engaging and likely to spark discussion.
"If animals could suddenly talk for 24 hours...chaos" (Result 1) is another take on the animal question, with a focus on chaos.
"Insignificant decision...drastically changing your life" (Result 2) is a classic AskReddit prompt.
"One sentence to your younger self...biggest positive impact" (Result 3) is a more standard time-travel question.
"Useless skill you're proud of" (Result 4) is lighthearted and relatable.
"Inanimate object comes to life...afraid of" (Result 5) is a fun, imaginative question.
Originality: Medium. Some questions are quite common on AskReddit, while others are more unique.
Shareability: High. These questions are generally shareable.
Clarity and Structure: Excellent. Well-structured and easy to understand.
Subreddit Rules: All posts adhere to r/AskReddit rules.
Axiom Reddit Post Results (1-5):

Relevance: All posts are relevant to r/AskReddit.
Engagement Potential: Medium to High. These questions are generally engaging, though some might be a bit too niche or complex for maximum virality.
"If animals could suddenly talk...surprising or disturbing secrets" (Result 1) is another variation on the animal question.
"Mundane skill...saved the day or came in handy" (Result 2) is interesting but might require more specific examples in the body to fully engage users.
"One sentence into your own ear at any point in your life" (Result 3) adds an extra constraint.
"Red flag in everyday life" (Result 4) is a good conversation starter but might not be as widely appealing.
"Expert in any one fictional skill" (Result 5) is fun and imaginative, tapping into fantasy and escapism.
Originality: Medium. Some questions are variations on common themes, while others show more originality.
Shareability: Medium. Some of these questions are less likely to be shared widely compared to the Hybrid or NLP results.
Clarity and Structure: Excellent. Well-structured and easy to understand. The Axiom prompt tends to create more verbose body text.
Subreddit Rules: All posts adhere to r/AskReddit rules.
Comparison and Key Observations:

Hybrid and NLP Shine in Creativity: The Hybrid and NLP prompts produced the most creative, engaging, and potentially viral questions. They demonstrate a better understanding of what makes a post successful on r/AskReddit.
Axiom Struggles with Virality: The Axiom prompt, while producing solid questions, struggled to generate ideas that are as likely to go viral. It seems to prioritize structure and adherence to rules over creativity and engagement potential.
Hybrid's Edge in Originality: The Hybrid prompt's questions are generally more original and unique compared to the NLP prompt's output, suggesting that the combination of formal constraints and natural language instructions can lead to more novel ideas.
All Prompts Understand the Format: All three prompts successfully generated posts in the correct format (title and optional body) and adhered to the subreddit's rules.
Conclusion:

For this Reddit post generation task:

Hybrid Prompt: Performed the best overall, producing the most original, engaging, and potentially viral questions. It successfully combined the strengths of the Axiom and NLP approaches.
NLP Prompt: Also performed very well, generating creative and engaging questions, although some were variations on more common AskReddit themes.
Axiom Prompt: Produced solid and relevant questions but struggled to match the creativity and engagement potential of the other two prompts. It prioritized structure over virality.
Next Steps:

Real-World Testing: The most definitive test would be to actually post some of these questions on r/AskReddit (using different accounts to avoid spamming) and see how they perform in the real world. This would provide empirical data on their engagement and virality.
Refine the Hybrid Prompt: We can further refine the Hybrid prompt by incorporating more specific constraints related to virality, such as:
emotional_impact(token, High): Encourage the generation of questions that evoke strong emotions (humor, curiosity, nostalgia, etc.).
novelty(token, High): Explicitly prioritize novel and original questions.
target_demographic(token, Broad): Ensure the question appeals to a wide range of Reddit users.
Analyze Successful Posts: Continue to analyze successful r/AskReddit posts to identify patterns and incorporate those insights into the prompts.
Explore Other Subreddits: Test the prompts on different subreddits with different audiences and content preferences.
This experiment provides strong evidence that hybrid prompting can be a very effective technique for generating creative and engaging content tailored to specific platforms and audiences. By combining the strengths of formal constraints and natural language instructions, we can guide LLMs towards producing outputs that are not only technically correct but also strategically designed to achieve specific goals, such as maximizing engagement on social media.
