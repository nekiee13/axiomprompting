Axiom-Based Prompt:

Objective: Generate Python code that simulates a simplified cryptocurrency (AxiomCoin) transaction system with validation rules.

Formalism:

Maximize: Σ ∆ID(token, i | prompt, L)

Subject to:

∀token ∈ Tokens, context(token, C) ∧ structure(token, PythonClass) ∧ coherence(token, R) ∧ logic(token, AxiomCoinLogic) ∧ format(token, ClassesMethods) ∧ errorHandling(token, EH)

Constraints and Definitions:

L: Not strictly limited, but prioritize concise and efficient code.

∆ID(token, i | prompt, L): The information gain of each token should contribute to a correct, efficient, and well-structured implementation of the AxiomCoin system in Python code, given the prompt and length constraints.

context(token, C): Each token must be contextually relevant to the Python code being generated, the AxiomCoin system's rules, and object-oriented programming principles.

structure(token, PythonClass): Each token must adhere to Python syntax and grammar, particularly regarding class definitions, method definitions, and object-oriented structure.

coherence(token, R): The generated code should be logically structured, readable, and maintainable, with clear relationships between classes and methods.

logic(token, AxiomCoinLogic): Each token must contribute to the correct implementation of the AxiomCoin system's logic, including wallet balances, transaction validation (sufficient funds, unique ID, no self-transactions, max amount, daily limit, founder bonus), and transaction processing.

format(token, ClassesMethods): The code must define three classes: Wallet (with methods get_balance(), deposit(amount), withdraw(amount)), Transaction, and Blockchain (with methods add_wallet(wallet), get_wallet(wallet_id), create_transaction(transaction), get_transaction_history(wallet_id), get_daily_transaction_count(wallet_id)).

errorHandling(token, EH): The code must include error handling to gracefully manage invalid transactions and print informative error messages.

init(Blockchain, InitWallets): The Blockchain class must be initialized with at least 3 wallets. One wallet must have the ID "FOUNDER" and have more than 0 balance.

Output Instructions:

Generate Python code that implements the AxiomCoin cryptocurrency system, strictly adhering to all the defined constraints. The code must define the Wallet, Transaction, and Blockchain classes with their respective methods, implement the validation logic, and handle errors appropriately.

Create a Wallet class to represent user wallets.

Each wallet should have a unique wallet_id (string) and a balance (non-negative integer).

Implement the following methods:

get_balance(): Returns the current balance.

deposit(amount): Adds amount to the balance.

withdraw(amount): Subtracts amount from the balance (only if sufficient funds are available).

2. Transaction Class:

Create a Transaction class to represent transactions.

Each transaction should have a unique transaction_id (string), sender_wallet_id (string), receiver_wallet_id (string), and amount (integer).

Okay, this is where things get very interesting! The NLP prompt has, in this case, attempted to generate the entire code in separate chunks, which is not what we intended. It's clear that the prompt was not interpreted perfectly by the model in this instance.

Analysis of the NLP Results (Chunks):

Let's analyze each chunk individually, as if they were a single, combined response (which is a generous interpretation, but let's see what we can learn):

NLP Code Result 1: Wallet Class

Correctness: The Wallet class is implemented correctly, with the right methods (get_balance, deposit, withdraw) and basic error handling for invalid deposit/withdrawal amounts.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Adheres to the specifications for the Wallet class.
NLP Code Result 2: Transaction Class

Correctness: Correctly implements the Transaction class, storing the necessary information (sender, receiver, amount, unique ID using uuid).
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Adheres to the specifications for the Transaction class.
NLP Code Result 3: Blockchain Class

Correctness: This is the most complex part, and it has several issues:
Inconsistent Transaction Storage: It stores transactions in a dictionary self.transactions using the ID as the key. This is fine, but it doesn't maintain the order of transactions, which might be important for a blockchain.
Daily Transaction Count Logic: It attempts to implement the daily transaction count using a dictionary self.daily_transaction_counts. The logic is mostly correct but could be simplified.
Founder Bonus: Implements the founder bonus, but gives a 10% bonus of the transaction amount to the reciever.
Missing Logic: No validation for unique transaction IDs is present, meaning transactions with duplicate IDs can be created.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python, but logically flawed in places.
Constraint Adherence:
Most methods are implemented, but there are errors in the logic, as mentioned above.
Unique Transaction ID check is missing.
NLP Code Result 4: Initialization and Testing

Correctness: The initialization and test transactions mostly work, but the results will be incorrect due to the errors in the Blockchain class logic.
Code Validity: Syntactically correct Python.
Constraint Adherence: Follows the instructions for initialization and testing.
Analysis of the Axiom Result:

Correctness: The solution is logically sound and correctly implements the rules of the puzzle, including the bonus for the "FOUNDER" wallet. The bonus amount is different than specified, which would be a minor error.
Code Validity: The code is syntactically correct and well-structured.
Constraint Adherence:
solve_puzzle() function is defined: CHECK
print() statements used: CHECK
No external libraries: CHECK
Efficiency: The solution is efficient and uses a clear, step-by-step approach.
Clarity: The code is easy to understand, and the comments are helpful in explaining the logic.
Comparison and Key Observations:

Axiom Prompt - Major Issues: While the Axiom prompt aimed for a highly structured approach, the complexity of the task seems to have overwhelmed its ability to generate complete and correct code in a single attempt. It failed to implement several core requirements.
NLP Prompt - Segmentation and Logical Errors: The NLP prompt, while producing more complete code, made a fundamental error by splitting the code into chunks. It also had some logical errors in the Blockchain class, particularly in handling unique transaction IDs and potentially the daily transaction count.
Complexity Barrier: This experiment suggests that there's a complexity threshold beyond which current LLMs, even with carefully engineered prompts, struggle to generate fully functional code that meets all requirements.
Possible Reasons for the Shortcomings:

Difficulty in Reasoning over Long Code: LLMs might struggle to maintain consistency and logical coherence when generating very long code snippets, especially when complex interdependencies exist between different parts of the code (like in this cryptocurrency system).
Limitations of Token-Based Prediction: The token-by-token generation process might make it difficult for the model to plan ahead and ensure that all parts of the code work together correctly.
Ambiguity in Constraints: Even with our best efforts, there might still be subtle ambiguities in the prompt that the LLM misinterprets.
Conclusion:

This "super complex" task proved to be very challenging for both prompting styles. Neither prompt produced a completely correct and fully functional solution. The NLP prompt got closer in terms of code structure, but had logical flaws. The Axiom prompt failed at implementing a lot of the core logic asked of it.




**Hybrid Prompt**

Objective: Generate Python code that simulates a simplified cryptocurrency (AxiomCoin) transaction system with validation rules. The code should be modular, well-structured, and adhere to object-oriented principles.

Formalism (Axiom-like):

Maximize: Σ ∆ID(token, i | prompt, L)

Subject to:

∀token ∈ Tokens, context(token, AxiomCoinContext) ∧ structure(token, PythonOOP) ∧ logic(token, AxiomCoinLogic) ∧ format(token, ModularCode)

Constraints and Definitions:

L: Not strictly limited, but prioritize concise, efficient, and readable code.

∆ID(token, i | prompt, L): The information gain of each token should contribute to a correct, efficient, well-structured, and logically sound implementation of the AxiomCoin system in Python code. Each token should add value to the overall functionality and clarity of the code.

AxiomCoinContext: The context is a cryptocurrency system named "AxiomCoin" with specific rules for wallets, transactions, and a blockchain.

PythonOOP: The code must adhere to Python syntax, grammar, and object-oriented programming principles. It should define classes with appropriate methods and attributes.

AxiomCoinLogic: The code must correctly implement the logic of the AxiomCoin system:

Wallet Management: Wallets have unique IDs and balances. Funds can be deposited and withdrawn.

Transaction Management: Transactions have unique IDs, sender, receiver, and amount.

Validation Rules:

Sufficient Funds: Sender must have enough funds.

Unique Transaction ID: Each transaction ID must be unique.

No Self-Transactions: Sender cannot be the same as the receiver.

Max Transaction Amount: A single transaction cannot exceed 100 AxiomCoins.

Daily Transaction Limit: A wallet can send at most 5 transactions per day.

Founder Bonus: A 10% bonus is added to the recipient's balance for transactions originating from the "FOUNDER" wallet.

ModularCode: The code must be organized into three classes:

:

Attributes: wallet_id (string), balance (non-negative integer).

Methods: get_balance(), deposit(amount), withdraw(amount) (with error handling for insufficient funds or invalid amounts).

:

Attributes: transaction_id (unique string), sender_wallet_id (string), receiver_wallet_id (string), amount (integer).

:

Methods:

add_wallet(wallet)

get_wallet(wallet_id)

create_transaction(transaction) (performs validation and processes the transaction, printing success/error messages)

get_transaction_history(wallet_id) (returns a list of transaction IDs)

get_daily_transaction_count(wallet_id) (returns the number of transactions sent by the wallet today)

Error Handling: The code should include robust error handling. Print informative error messages in cases like insufficient funds, invalid transaction amounts, exceeding daily limits, duplicate transaction IDs, self-transactions, or non-existent wallet IDs.

Natural Language Instructions (NLP):

Design and implement a simplified cryptocurrency system called "AxiomCoin" in Python using object-oriented programming. The system should consist of three classes: Wallet, Transaction, and Blockchain.

The Wallet class should manage user wallets, each with a unique wallet_id and a balance. Implement methods to get the balance, deposit, and withdraw funds.

The Transaction class should represent a transaction with a unique transaction_id, sender_wallet_id, receiver_wallet_id, and amount.

The Blockchain class should manage the wallets and transactions. It should allow adding wallets, getting wallet details, creating and validating transactions, getting transaction history for a wallet, and getting the daily transaction count for a wallet.

Validation Rules (Detailed):

Sufficient Funds: Ensure that a sender has enough funds before processing a transaction.

Unique Transaction ID: Each transaction must have a unique ID. Use the uuid module to generate unique IDs.

No Self-Transactions: Prevent wallets from sending funds to themselves.

Maximum Transaction Amount: Limit the maximum amount of a single transaction to 100 AxiomCoins.

Daily Transaction Limit: Limit each wallet to sending a maximum of 5 transactions per day. You can use a simplified date/time mechanism for testing (e.g., a transaction counter that resets manually or a simple date attribute).

Special Wallet Bonus: If the sender's wallet ID is "FOUNDER", add a 10% bonus to the recipient's balance.

Initialization:

Initialize the Blockchain with at least three wallets. One wallet must have the ID "FOUNDER" and a non-zero starting balance.

Error Handling:

Implement error handling to catch invalid operations (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid amounts, exceeding limits, duplicate IDs) and print informative error messages to the console.

Result Identifier:

Each generated code snippet must begin with the following phrase: "Hybrid Code Result [Number]:"

here is the hybrid prompt response to compare the the original nlp vs axiom prompt for this puzzle


**Hybrid Code Result 1 Analysis:**

Correctness: The code correctly implements most of the features of the AxiomCoin system:
Wallet Management: Wallet class correctly handles deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
Transaction Management: Transaction class correctly stores transaction details.
Blockchain Management: Blockchain class correctly adds wallets, retrieves wallets, and processes transactions.
Validation Rules: Most validation rules are correctly implemented:
Sufficient Funds: Checks for sufficient funds before a transaction.
No Self-Transactions: Prevents self-transactions.
Max Transaction Amount: Limits transactions to 100 AxiomCoins.
Daily Transaction Limit: Correctly limits to 5 transactions per day.
Founder Bonus: Correctly applies a 10% bonus to the recipient when the sender is "FOUNDER".
Error Handling: Includes error handling for most invalid operations and prints informative messages.
Code Validity: The code is syntactically correct Python and runs without errors.
Constraint Adherence:
AxiomCoinContext: The code clearly implements the AxiomCoin system.
PythonOOP: The code follows object-oriented principles with well-defined classes and methods.

ModularCode: The code is well-organized into the three required classes (Wallet, Transaction, Blockchain).
Error Handling: Error handling is implemented and informative messages are printed.
Completeness: All required classes and methods are implemented.
Efficiency: The code is reasonably efficient. Data structures like dictionaries are used appropriately.
Clarity: The code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand. Comments could be added for more clarity, but the code is self-explanatory to a large extent.
Robustness: The code is relatively robust and handles most edge cases gracefully.
Minor Issues:

Duplicate Transaction ID: There isn't a check to make sure that a transaction ID is unique when creating a transaction.
Timestamp: While the Transaction class does create a timestamp, this is not used in any of the logic of the code.

Significantly Improved over Axiom: This hybrid result is vastly superior to the previous Axiom-only attempt, which had major logical flaws and failed to implement many features correctly.
Comparable and potentially slightly better than NLP: This hybrid result is comparable to the best NLP result, fixing the daily transaction issue, but missing a check for duplicate transaction IDs.
Conclusion:

The hybrid prompt has produced a very strong result, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining formal constraints with natural language instructions. The generated code is largely correct, well-structured, and implements almost all the features of the AxiomCoin system. The minor issues identified can be easily fixed with a small amount of manual refinement or further prompt iteration.

Key Takeaways:

Hybrid Prompting is Powerful: This experiment provides compelling evidence that hybrid prompting can be a highly effective strategy for complex code generation tasks, outperforming both pure Axiom-based and pure NLP prompting.
Formalisms Help with Structure and Logic: The Axiom-like part of the prompt likely contributed to the well-defined structure and the implementation of most validation rules.
NLP Helps with Overall Understanding: The natural language instructions likely helped the LLM grasp the overall context and intent of the task, leading to a more complete implementation.
Iterative Refinement is Still Important: Even with a strong hybrid prompt, some iteration or manual refinement might be needed to achieve a perfect result.
